# Chart Data

To get started, add a "config.js" file in public > assets > scripts.

Inside the config.js file, use the following logic to set the api_key and client_id


    var config = {    
    MY_KEY : '',
    CLIENT_ID : '' 
    }

Add your api_key and client_id to the file, and then run `npm install`, and finally `node server.js`.

Open your browser to http://localhost:8080 once the server has started.
